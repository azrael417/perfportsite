# Performance Analysis Tools

Evaluating application performance portability across diverse computing
architectures often requires the aid of performance analysis tools. Such tools
provide detailed information and statistics characterizing an application's
usage of the architecture, and can guide the developer as she optimizes
bottlenecks to achieve higher performance.

Each ASCR facility is equipped with a wide range of tools for measuring
application performance. The applications running at the three facilities
exhibit a broad range of demands from computer architectures - some are limited
by memory bandwidth, others by latency, and others still by the CPU itself. The
performance measurement tools available at the ASCR facilities can measure in
detail how an application uses each of these resources. They include, but are
not limited to, the list provided below:

- Intel VTune Amplifier: *(WIP)*
- Intel Advisor: *(WIP)*
- Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector: *(WIP)*
- Allinea MAP: *(WIP)*
- TAU: *(WIP)*
- nvprof: *(WIP)*

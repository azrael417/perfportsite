Bronson to write

Libraries e.g. BLAS/FFT, MAGMA, CULA, Trillinos, PETSc

Pros

* Often encapsulate much of the computational intensity found in scientific codes

* Can allow immediate portability under some circumstances

* Performance becomes a task for library authors/maintainers

Cons

* Limited set of portable libraries at present

* May not capture all the important/expensive tasks in a given code  

* Often require recasting data structures to match library requirements

* Opaque interior threading models

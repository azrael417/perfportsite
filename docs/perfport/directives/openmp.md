# OpenMP

OpenMP is a specification for a set of compiler directives, library routines,
and environment variables that can be used to specify high-level parallelism in
Fortran and C/C++ programs. The OpenMP API uses the fork-join model of parallel
execution. Multiple threads of execution perform tasks defined implicitly or
explicitly by OpenMP directives. (_Text taken from OpenMP FAQ and API
specification._)
